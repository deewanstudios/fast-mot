90,Lisa,"Passed my MOT with them. They aren't the cheapest but I was looking for personal service and Adem and his colleagues did not disappoint. I needed a tightening of my hand brakes for another time but on inspecting the car Adem didn't think it was worth the high labour cost to fix the adjustment I wanted, he explained that the car was still sound and roadworthy. Not only was he honest, he didn't charge for the inspection. I had a good experience and would definitely return to use them again. Thanks Adem and Team.",2015-05-0614:09:20
89,Michelle,"Was in garage today & received excellent customer service from Matthew, only went in for M.O.T but would definitely recommend to others. The ONLY negative is the location, it's not a garage you would easily notice unfortunately & therefore a lot of people are really missing out on a very well run, honest (no bullxxxt) & reliable team, headed by Adam. 
<br/>
<br/>Many of us have been to various garages before & know we are paying over the odds, so why not give these guys a go. You will be pleasantly surprised & return time & time again. ",2015-04-0921:34:58

73,Maggie,"This is the best garage I have ever found - and there have been many.  Most of them either produce shoddy work, overcharge or rip off women, but Adem at FAST MOT is the most honest and trustworthy garage owner you will ever find.  The work is very fast, reasonably priced and of great quality, and the service is second to none.  They will do your MOT while you wait in their clean and comfortable waiting area and their service is friendly, polite, helpful and totally dependable.  If you thought service with a smile was a thing of the past, think again - it's still alive and well at FAST MOT.  I never want to go anywhere else now and I have already recommended them to my friends.",2014-08-0818:32:54

I feel completely confident that I am getting the best service and would highly recommend them.  Recently I had a problem with my car which was quite a specialist problem, and although it was not a job that Adam and his team could help with he researched and located another garage and spoke to them on my behalf and got all the information I needed to make an informed decision.  Thank you!
